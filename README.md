# Alpinist-Examples

This repository contains the source code of examples in the paper "Alpinist: an Annotation-Aware GPU Program Optimizer" submitted to the International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems (TACAS) 2022. 

The implementation of the annotated-program optimizer, which is implemented in the VerCors verifier, is available [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/tree/gpgpu-optimizations).
